# CourseraCapstoneProject

This project is one which must be completed in order to obtain the professional certificate offered by coursera, and is part of the 12 course series.
The learning and courses is provided by IBM and is accessible at the url below.

The project takes inspiration from SpaceX and their success with their Falcon-9 Rocket, in particular, Stage one, which is a reusable section of the rocket.
Perhaps their success is through being able to provide cheaper space travel at a price of around 65 million USD, compared to their competitors who provide services
for over 165 million USD. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The project can be broken down into the following sections:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
- Predictive Analysis (Classification)
- Presenting the Findings

1. During exploratory data analysis Restful API will be used alongside webscraping to find and convert data into a dataframe and perform data wrangling.
2. Afterwards a dashboard will be built to analyse launch records using Plotly Dash. An interactive map will be built to analyse the launch site proximity with Folium.
3. Next, machine learning will be used to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. The data will be split between training and test data to find the best hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression. The method that performs the best using the test data will then be found.
4. Finally, all these activities will come together in one place and the data-driven insights will be delivered to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully.

I hope you enjoy exploring one of my first projects on github and I wish you the best of luck! :-)
